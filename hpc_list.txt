sample format: 

NAME: <cluster name>
URL: <url>
OS: <name of os>
SCHEDULER: <name of scheduler>
FILE SYS: <name of distributed/ parllel file systems>
BEST SITE: <name of best cloudlab site for implementing the system>
NOTES: <whatever you want to say>

NAME: Red
NOTES: seems like a bad choice. It is actually made of multiple clusters 
in remote locations, so it is bad for jobs that that require message
passing, which may be the kind of test programs we will run. 

NAME: Beacon
URL: https://www.nics.utk.edu/beacon
OS: Linux
SCHEDULER: Torque/Moab
FILE SYS: Lustre
BEST SITE: ???
NOTES: Could be good, seems like there is nothing remarkable about it. 
Also, Torque and Moab are related to PBS. 

NAME: XStream
URL: https://portal.xsede.org/stanford-xstream#compenv
OS: Linux 
SCHEDULER: Slurm
FILE SYS: Lustre
BEST SITE: ???
NOTES: designed for computing with GPUS, each node has 8 GPUS. Also, I 
couldn't find any info about installation, so this may be a bad choice. 

NAME: Cypress
URL: <url>
OS: Unix
SCHEDULER: YARN?
FILE SYS: Hadoop
BEST SITE: <name of best cloudlab site for implementing the system>
NOTES: Has similar documentation to Palmetto so it might be the safest bet.
