NAME: <cluster name>
URL: <url>
OS: <name of os>
SCHEDULER: <name of scheduler>
FILE SYS: <name of distributed/ parllel file systems>
BEST SITE: <name of best cloudlab site for implementing the system>
NOTES: <whatever you want to say>

NAME: Beacon
URL: https://www.nics.utk.edu/beacon
OS: Linux
SCHEDULER: Torque/Moab
FILE SYS: Lustre
BEST SITE: Wisconsin
NOTES: Could be good, seems like there is nothing remarkable about it. 
Also, Torque and Moab are related to PBS. 

NAME: Red
NOTES: seems like a bad choice. It is actually made of multiple clusters 
in remote locations, so it is bad for jobs that that require message
passing, which may be the kind of test programs we will run.
