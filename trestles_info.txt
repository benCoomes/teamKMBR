Trestles was originally installed at UCSD, so maybe there is documentation
about it available on UCSD websites as well.

It seems like trestles was removed from the XSEDE resources page... Maybe
we should mention this to Dr. Ngo? 

from http://hpc.uark.edu/hpc-resources/index.php - 
256 cmputer nodes, all have quad octa-core AMD Opteron 2.5GHz processors
with 64 GB of memory and 120GB of SSD local disk. Interconnection is 
provided by 324-port QDR 4- Gbps nonblocking Mellanox Infiniband switch, 
and is connected to Lustre file systems with 16TB of scratch space and 350TB
of main storage. (Is that storage for the whole system? Seems small. At 
least the nodes are homogenous, so we can make a homogenous cluster on 
cloudLab).

We could try to sign up for training or request resources here:

Good info here: http://hpcwiki.uark.edu/doku.php/trestles_usage
Trestles has more cores which are less powerful (than the Razor computer), 
so it is better suited to code with good parallel performance.
