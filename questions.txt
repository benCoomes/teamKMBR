How do we use module? 
	Where/how do we install software to be loaded with module?

The tutorials for installing mpi on multiple nodes say to use NFS to create a 
shared directory for use with mpi. Do we need NFS to get mpi to work, or will 
Lustre do the job of NFS? 
see: http://mpitutorial.com/tutorials/running-an-mpi-cluster-within-a-lan/ 

The same mpi tutorial also says to install openssh-server... do we need to do this?
Also, it says that one node should be a master node and the others are slaves. How
should this be managed on a shared system where users request subsets of available
nodes? 

Where should we modify the PATH varible, if necessary? 

Should mountable directories only be created after lustre is installed? 

After completing the install of openmpi, is it okay to remove the directory
produced by untaring the openmpi tarball? (openmpi-1.10.3.tar.gz) If not, 
where should this directory be located?
