How do we use module? 
	Where/how do we install software to be loaded with module?
	module must be installed. after installation, create modulefiles in the 
	modulfiles directory (run 'module avil' to see where this is) to load
	software using module. The software can be installed anywhere, 
	because modulefiles just modify PATH so that the software is included. 

The tutorials for installing mpi on multiple nodes say to use NFS to create a 
shared directory for use with mpi. Do we need NFS to get mpi to work, or will 
Lustre do the job of NFS? 
see: http://mpitutorial.com/tutorials/running-an-mpi-cluster-within-a-lan/ 
still need nfs - they serve different purposes. Lustre is for performance file 
sharing for running parallel applications. NFS is not fast, but it is good for 
creating mountable directories to store shared software in. 

The same mpi tutorial also says to install openssh-server... do we need to do this?
Also, it says that one node should be a master node and the others are slaves. How
should this be managed on a shared system where users request subsets of available
nodes? 
Yes, openssh-server will need to be installed. 

Where should we modify the PATH varible, if necessary? 
A: /etc/profile

Should mountable directories only be created after lustre is installed? 
no, these are created with NFS

After completing the install of openmpi, is it okay to remove the directory
produced by untaring the openmpi tarball? (openmpi-1.10.3.tar.gz) If not, 
where should this directory be located? 
yes, it can be removed

module install - try manual install to /usr/local - see installation instructions
for cluster here: 

to save path when sudoing to su, use sudo -i <command>
